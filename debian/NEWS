postgis (2.2.0~rc1+dfsg-1~exp2) experimental; urgency=medium

  Debian is now shipping PostGIS version 2.2 and dropped support for 2.1,
  meaning bug or security fixes will no longer be provided for the older
  one. This means it is strongly recommended to migrate all databases to the
  newer PostGIS version 2.2 as soon as possible.

  Of course, databases that are already using PostGIS 2.1 will continue to
  work. Note, however, that with this upgrade it is no longer possible
  to create version 2.1 of the extension PostGIS. Instead, 'CREATE
  EXTENSION postgis;' will now give you version 2.2. Note that this can also
  affects backups.

postgis (2.1.3+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=high

  It has come to our attention that the PostGIS Raster support
  may give more privileges to users than an administrator is
  willing to grant.

  These include reading files from the filesystem and opening
  connections to network hosts.

  Both issues can be limited in existing installations by setting
  the GDAL_SKIP variable (in the PostgreSQL server environment)
  to the list of all gdal drivers, but some drivers would still be
  forceably loaded by some operations.

  This release strengthens the code to load no drivers by default
  and allows for a fine-grained tuning of what's allowed and what
  not through postgis-specific environment variables:

  - POSTGIS_GDAL_ENABLED_DRIVERS
    Specifies a list of GDAL drivers to _enable_ (rather than _skip_)
    By default all drivers are disabled.
    Example value: "GTiff PNG JPEG"

  - POSTGIS_ENABLE_OUTDB_RASTERS
    Enables read support for out-db raster bands if set to 1.
    By default out-db raster bands reading is disabled.

  On Debian, you can easily set these via the following file:
  /etc/postgresql/${PG_VERSION}/${CLUSTER_NAME}/environment
